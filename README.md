# Shakespeare-GPT
This project is a follow along guided by Andrej Karpathy's ["Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out"](url) in his NN: Zero to Hero series. 
It includes the toy dataset, a colection of lines from Shakespeare (input.txt), and ShakespeareGPT.ipynb the file to train and sample from the model.
